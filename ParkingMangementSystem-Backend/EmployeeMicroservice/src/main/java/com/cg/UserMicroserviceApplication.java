/**
 * @author Win10
 * we're using @SpringBootApplication as our primary application configuration class; behind the scenes, 
 * that's equivalent to @Configuration, @EnableAutoConfiguration, and @ComponentScan together .
 * 
 * @Configuration annotation is part of the spring core framework. Spring Configuration annotation indicates that the class has
 * @Bean definition methods ie. allows us to use annotations for dependency injection.
 *  
 * first step of defining Spring Beans is by adding the right annotation — @Component or @Service or @Repository.However, 
 * Spring does not know about the bean unless it knows where to search for it.This part of “telling Spring where to search” 
 * is called a @ComponentScan . we define the packages that have to be scanned.
 * 
 * @EnableAutoConfiguration tries to automatically configure our Spring application based upon the JAR dependency we have 
 * added in the classpath. eg. tomcat and SpringMVC are auto configured .
